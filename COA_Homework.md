- 1.1: Explain the first of the two important ideas stated in Section 1.5.

- 1.13: Two computers, A and B, are identical except for the fact that A has a subtract instruction and B does not.
Both have add instructions. Both have instructions that can take a value and produce the negative of the value.
Which computer is able to solve more problems, A or B? Prove your result.

- 1.17: Briefly describe the difference between an ISA and a microarchitecture

- 2.1: Given *n* bits, how many distinct combinations of the *n* bits exist?

- 2.4: Given *n* bits, how many unsigned integers can be represented with the n bits?
What is the range of these integers?

- 2.5: Using 5 bits to represent each number, write the representations of 7 and -7 in 1's complement, signed magnitude, and 2's complement integers.

# Homework 1 questions
- 2.2: There are 26 characters in the alphabet we use for writing English. 
What is the least number of bits needed to give each character a unique bit pattern?
How many bits would we need to distinguish between upper and lower case versions of all 26 characters?

- 2.8: 
    a. What is the largest positive number one can represent in an 8-bit 2's complement code? Write your result in binary and decimal.
    b. What is the greatest magnitude negative number one can represent in an 8-bit 2's complement code? Write your result in binary and decimal.
    c. What is the largest positive number one can represent in n-bit 2's complemnt code?
    d. What is the greatest magnitude negative number one can represent in n-bit 2's complement code?

- 2.10: Convert the following 2's complement binary numbers to decimal
    a. 1010
    b. 01011010
    c. 11111110
    d. 0011100111010011

- 2.11: Convert these decimal numbers to 8-bit 2's complement binary numbers
    a. 102
    b. 64
    c. 33
    d. -128
    e. 127

- 2.12: If the last digit of a 2's complement binary number is 0, then the number is even. 
If the last two digits of a 2's complement binary number are 00 (eg., the binary number 01100), what does that tell you about the number?
